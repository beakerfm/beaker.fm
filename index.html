  We live in a world under threat of disillusion. In many ways that makes it majestic.
    Don't stop believing there is good in the world, else there won't be.
    Remeber all of us are in this together.

 <h1>
  Exploit Lab
 </h1>
 <p>
  Terraform is an incredibly useful tool for defining infrastructure as code.
Its ease of setup and teardown make it an great tool to use for creating exploit lab environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub">
   Vulhub
  </a>
  is a popular repository which containers vulnerable docker images.
As exploits usually apply to specific environmnets and package versions
Docker is an ideal way to package these vulnerable tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Historically deployment of vulnerable machines to test on required some secret
Windows VM with a sketchy set of license keys, passed around on a USB drive at DefCon.
Some companies recognized this and tried to create there own vulnerability testing environments,
but these were hard to deploy and poorly maintained.
 </p>
 <p>
  As they say in devops (or DevSecOps or whatever we call people who manage modern infrastrucutre)
"if it ain't SaaS or containerized, it aint deployed".
Vulhub allows us to apply the same mentality to vulnerability and exploit testing.
Without a vulnerability, there is no exploitation.
Understand how to manage, version and deploy containerized applications is therefore important
for any security focused team.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Terraform
 </h2>
 <p>
  Its easy to get started with Terraform.
An example lab environment deployed on DigitalOcean with a random vulnerable container
from Vulhub can be found
  <a href="https://github.com/beakerfm/expoit-lab">
   here: FULL EXAMPLE
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is required to install Terraform (duh!) and generate an API key for DigitalOcean and 
create an SSH key.
You should create a brand new key that can be thrown away as this is an exploit lab!
 </p>
 <p>
  Variables are declared to allow for referencing these parameters in the Terraformed infrastructure.
As it is provided in the example respoitory above and described in the
  <code>
   digitalocean.tf
  </code>
  configuration,
 </p>
 <pre><code>variable "DO" {}
variable "PRIVATE" {}
variable "PUBLIC" {}
</code></pre>
 <p>
  A provider in Terraform is the mechanism which enables deployment of infrastrucutre across various cloud
providers such as DO, AWS, Azure, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the hood Terraform runs API calls to provision the infrastrucutre hence an API key is required.
 </p>
 <pre><code>terraform {
  required_providers {
    digitalocean = {
      source = "digitalocean/digitalocean"
      version = "~&gt; 2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "digitalocean" {
  token = var.DO
}
</code></pre>
 <p>
  The SSH key is similarly declared to allow for running scripts on the deployed machine.
In this case downloading docker and running a vulnerable image from Vulhub.
 </p>
 <pre><code>resource "digitalocean_ssh_key" "terraform-blah" {
  name       = "DO Terraform Exploit Lab"
  public_key = file(var.PUBLIC)
}
</code></pre>
 <p>
  The server itself is a Centos 7 server deployed in the Singapore region.
As this is infrastructure as code, the specs of the machine are declared.
 </p>
 <pre><code>resource "digitalocean_droplet" "victim" {
  image              = "centos-7-x64"
  name               = "vulnerable-host"
  region             = "sgp1"
  size               = "s-1vcpu-2gb"
  monitoring         = false
  ipv6               = false
  ssh_keys           = [digitalocean_ssh_key.terraform-blah.fingerprint]
.
.
.
</code></pre>
 <p>
  In order to run provisioning scripts on the deployed VM the
  <code>
   remote-exec
  </code>
  functionality is leveraged
for simplicity. Ansible, Packer, and other tools can of course be used for configuration management,
but simplicity is the goal!
 </p>
 <pre><code> connection {
    host        = self.ipv4_address
    user        = "root"
    type        = "ssh"
    private_key = file(var.PRIVATE)
    timeout     = "2m"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    scripts = [
      "bin/centos7-docker-install.sh",
      "bin/vulhub-install.sh"
    ]
  }
</code></pre>
 <p>
  The first script
  <code>
   bin/centos7-docker-install.sh
  </code>
  installs
  <code>
   docker
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   docker-compose
  </code>
  .
The script in
  <code>
   bin/vulhub-install.sh
  </code>
  pulls down a random vulnerable image.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only commands then needed from the Terraform binary are
 </p>
 <pre><code>terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
</code></pre>
 <p>
  That's it, the machine is now deploying and you just have to wait for the packages to be deployed.
Wait, study and get ready to do some recon and exploitation!
 </p>
 <p>
  The environment can be destroyed with
 </p>
 <pre><code>terraform destroy
</code></pre>
 <p>
  Rinse and repeat!
