# Finance for Almost Anyone
There are a lot of different finance tricks that no one will tell you about.
The basic principals of wealth management can actually be quite simple.

You should first start to think more holistically about your wealth.
Don't just think about the amount of money you get paid from the company you work for.
And of course you have think about your expenses, but this should be considered in relationship
to your whole wealth when making descisions to purchase.

Investments can compound and grow ones wealth at a rapid pace.
When you decide to buy a house or a car or choose to rent instead
you are fundamentally making an investment decision.

The best investments grow over time.
Time being the main consideration.
The earlier you can afford to and reconignize the power of saving the better off you will be.
And not just yourself but your family as well.
Think in generational timelines.
Think like the wealthy and you can enjoy many of the benefits.

## Retirement
If you are young retirement seems like a long way off, but saving for it early can change your life.
Remember to think of wealth holistically so money you save in your 401k or IRA or other retirement accounts
count towards your networth.

You can take out loans on your 401k and IRA to purchase your first house for instance instead of going to the bank.
Not that this is the best advice, but it is merely an example of the flexibility of your accounts.

If you are fortunate enough to live or work in the USA, 401k managers are the best fund managers in the world.
