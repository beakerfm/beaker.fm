# Thought4Code: HelloWorld


Install a Python interpreter on your machine,
create a new file called `hello.py`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello World")
```

You can then run this code with `python hello.py`.

It is as simple as that to get started.
It is possible to run code directly in the interpreter with

```
python
Python 3.8.2 (default, Jun  8 2021, 11:59:35)
[Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

It is possible to then run commands at the prompt!

Note: You should be using Python3 by now :)
