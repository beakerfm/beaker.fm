# Thought4Code: HelloWorld


Code is a powerful tool.
It powers the modern world.
If you have a computer, you have access to code.
Code can change the world!

## Getting Started
I wondered what it would be like to run my first program
after reading the lines of code from a paper book.
It is a rite of passage to create a program which produces the
following text.
The language this ritual is performed in changes with the times.
Today we will use Python.

Install a Python interpreter on your machine
and create a new file called `hello.py`.

* [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
* [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Add the following contents to the file
```
print("Hello World")
```

After you save the file open a terminal (Mac) or cmd prompt (Windows)
and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
You can then run this code with `python hello.py`.

The text "Hello World" should be printed to the screen.
It takes many transistors to make this work!
The electrical engineer knows this, the programmer takes it for granted
nowadays. This is always how society progresses.

But it is nice that it is as simple as that to get started.

## Running Commands
It is possible to run code directly in the interpreter with

```
python
```
You should then see a prompt similar to
```
Python 3.8.2 (default, Jun  8 2021, 11:59:35)
[Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.11)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

It is possible to then run commands at the prompt!

Try to print some text by running 

```
>>>print("Some more text")
```

Congrats you can write code!

Note: You should be using Python3 by now :)
